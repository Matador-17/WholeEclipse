  Scenario: Add New Employee
    Given I open browser and navigated to the HRMS
    And I am logged into HRMS
    And I navigated to Add Employee Page
    When I add firstName, middleName and lastName
    And I click Save
    Then I verify Employee has been succesfully added
    And I close the browser
